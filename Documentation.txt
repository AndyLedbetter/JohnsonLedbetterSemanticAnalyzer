PEX 1 DOCUMENTATION:

I received help from C1C Joeseph Daniel on this part on the pex. He showed me how to include whitespaces in strings.
We also checked each other's test files to see that they are correct. I did not receive any other help on this assignment.


PEX 2 DOCUMENTATION:

I did not receive any help on this assignment. I did have to ask C1C Andy Ledbetter for help on creating
a correct float token (ex. 10.0e8), but he did not not assist me on any PEX 2 material.
